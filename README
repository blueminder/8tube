8tube

8tube is a Google Chrome Extension that automatically pauses the song you are listening to on 8tracks when a YouTube video is played. Once the YouTube video is no longer playing, 8tube brings you right back to your 8tracks listening experience. No dead air!

This extension is based off of Marco Munizaga's TubeShark (https://github.com/MarcoPolo/tubeShark) which unlocks the same functionality for GrooveShark users.
